50,2023,8,EB,"Everything is fine, except for the cold feel of the common areas. Maybe a little too futuristic, but there is no warmth. It's not spooky, but close to it. Rooms are comfortable, the bathrooms are great, the staff is accomodating."
30,2023,7,First class team,The team at the Armani were amongst the best I‚Äôve ever encountered. Friendly and helpful at every turn. Breakfast was truly amazing with unbelievably fresh fruit and vegetables. The room technology was cumbersome and overdone but the team was always there to help out. Overall we enjoyed our stay though I believe I would choose a bit more of a full service hotel in the future for the price point.
50,2023,7,Modernist Milano,"The Armani is a strikingly modern hotel in the heart of beautiful Milan. While extremely comfortable and well-appointed, it took a bit of work to get used to the iPad managed controls for everything from lights to televisions to doors. It is perfect for those who are very comfortable with technology. You enter on the ground floor and then take an elevator up to 7th floor reception. From there you take another elevator back down or up to your floor to find your room. It would have been helpful for someone to show us how the room worked, and even how to open the door, but that did not happen. We spent way too much time trying to figure out how the room worked. The mini-bar was complementary and we had a voucher for room service which we used. The three-story Armani store is just down the street from the hotel. The included breakfast was nice, but service was slow. The Concierge desk not very helpful either. Overall, an interesting but very non-traditional experience. When in Milan, I would prefer to see the sights not spend time on how to turn off the lights to go to sleep."
50,2023,6,Modern luxurious stay with very friendly staff,"We stayed in this hotel for 5 nights to explore Milan and do some shopping. The room we got was spacious with a large terrace. The staff was extremely friendly and helped us swiftly with all questions and requests we had. The location of the hotel is great, especially since it is right next to a metro stop"
50,2023,5,Better than heaven a true testament of Armani style and detail,No question this is the only place to stay in Milan . The staff is overly qualified. The building is extremely comfortable. The food is five star the location is central and convenient to all things Milan There‚Äôs no question of selection this is the only one
50,2023,5,Outstanding time at Armani in Milan,Fantastic experience at the Armani Hotel in Milan. From the moment of arrival until I left the staff at the hotel went out of their way to make my trip completely enjoyable. Virtually all the staff recognized me by my name on each encounter. The Jr Suite was perfect in every respect including the desk area where I needed to work for a couple of hours each day. Restaurant at d bar were excellent as was the fitness level. And the location is spectacular. Will definitely go back ASAP.
40,2023,4,armani hotel milano,"location was great, staff not so great, asked for ashtray when arrived but didn't get it , asked for bathroom cleaning but nobody came to clean, children can't use swimming pool or jacuzzi what should be written on hotel site, we stayed one night less because rain was forecasted and we could not go to spa with our son, be careful when you receive check I got bigger bills twice,"
50,2023,3,"Exceptional service, design and amenities","Exceptional hotel -- the service and amenities leave nothing to be desired. Everywhere you look is beautifully designed. The rooms are modern, high-tech and very comfortable. The hotel is located within the best shopping district, steps to the Duomo and the Galleria. The staff is friendly and helpful. Highly recommend!"
50,2023,3,"Excellet location, service and design","The Armani hotel is beautiful, modern and elegant. The service and amenities are exceptional and it is located within the best shopping district, steps from the Duomo and several good restaurants are nearby. Rooms are beautifully designed and high-tech. Highly recommended."
50,2022,3,Greatest Experience in This Stylish and Well Designed Hotel,"I stayed in Armani Hotel Milano a couple of times. As you probably know, this is one of the best hotels in Milan. Nice style, top quality, great service. If you need to book or order anything concierge would do it for you right away. Make sure to check the Armani restaurant which is on the 7th floor, great steak, pasta, deserts, wines, etc. Grazie Armani. I will be back."
50,2023,2,Beautiful experience.,"This was the most beautiful hotel I‚Äôve stayed in. Top service, amazing modern amenities I haven‚Äôt experienced in any other hotel. Perfect location. I‚Äôd 100 percent recommend this place! Everything was perfect. We controlled everything in the room with our iPad, the lights, music, shades. This is an epic hotel."
40,2023,2,"Beautiful hotel, needs maintenance and an upgrade","Beautiful property but needs some maintenance, is starting to look old, if you have been to the Dubai property, don‚Äôt expect the same level. Food‚Ä¶ not the best, sad to say that probably one of the worst pastas I had in Milan. But definitely a great hotel. Staff is awesome!"
50,2023,2,"Beautiful hotel, lovely staff","The hotel is beautiful as one would expect, what made the difference were the receptionists etc. who were very helpful and kind. I was feeling unwell when I checked out and was so impressed that the person on reception arranged a bottle of water to be waiting for me when got to the ground floor"
50,2022,11,EXCELLENT STAFF,"Excellent location, remarkable service and food. Everyone was gentle and polite. We loved the privacy the hotels offers. Breakfast was great. The quality of the food amazed us!!! The desserts area was our favorite spot."
50,2022,12,Amazing Christmas with Armani!,"This was a superb stay, from beginning to end. The staff was kind, attentive, and paid attention to every detail. The drinks were 100%, and the food was excellent. Cannot say enough good things. We were there over Christmas, and the entire team went out of their way to make sure our stay was amazing. We hope to come back soon!"
50,2022,12,One of the best trip to Armani Milan,"Armani Milan made our trip to Milan is one of the best trip ever..location is fantastic ‚Äî everything is in a walking distance .. I took junior suite with balcony, and it was a very nice room with beautiful view.. will visit again for sure .."
50,2022,11,I love this hotel,"It is truly difficult to find a flaw in this hotel because it is simply perfect. To start with, the reservation staff was patient and courteous, they even called us before we arrived to make sure everything was alright. Then from the moment we walked in, we were greeted with kindness. Then they upgraded us to an executive suite without us even asking. It kept getting better from that moment on. The bathroom is so comfortable and spacious, the AC worked wonderfly, and the amenities covered everything from the toothbrush to everything else. The suit was smart and we were able to control everything with an eye pad. Relaxing music was always playing in the hallways. There was a business center. The breakfast was by far the best I ever had in a hotel. Housekeeping was always fast to‚Ä¶"
50,2022,11,One of the best hotel in Milano,"I do love the venue, as well as the team, was wonderful to deal with. They supported me with all kinds of services that you even can think about it. Once again highly recommended and thank the Armani team üôèüèª"
50,2022,11,Armani in the heart of Milan,The concierge services at this hotel is above and beyond. Excellent staff! Great location. Lighting is a bit dark and it is hard to see in the bathroom...otherwise great experience. Wonderful breakfast buffet.
50,2022,9,Armani/Millano,"Out of many optuions, I decided to stay in the Armani hotel. It met all of my expectations, cool design, prompt service, attentive staff. Nothing to complain about, quite to the contrary. Not my first stay and hopefuly not the last one."
50,2022,7,Summer in Milan at Armani,"Spacious room, friendly staff and housekeepers. I loved how high-tech all the amenities were and how comforting it is to get everything done through the iPad, including opening the door and ordering in-room dining. Contact was minimized to the comfort of the guests. Mini bar was constantly restocked and receptionists were very helpful with guiding us around the city for shopping and food cafes. Also, an extra +++ was the location. Everything was walking distance!"
30,2022,8,Outdated by now,"Even the hotel was once well designed, many interior parts are now worn out and don‚Äôt work well. Shame the main restaurant is closed for the whole of August so you must go outside for dinner. Hotel is on a main road so plenty of noise and does not look special compared to several similar nearby hotels. Hotel staff are amazing though"
50,2022,6,Great Location in the heart of Milano,Armani level of service is the best. The facility decor is breathtaking. The team is super professional and caring for your needs. Location is great and the restaurant is spectacular. Definitely recommended.
50,2022,5,Armani gets an ‚ÄúA+‚Äù,"When you enter the hotel, you are greeted cordially, your luggage is whisked away and you are transported to the reception area where you are welcomed again. Check-in is easy and then you are escorted to your totally fashionably (obviously) designed room with all the modern conveniences. An iPad has all the controls for the room, the curtains puddle beautifully, the bathroom is stunning in marble with a separate shower and tub, you can even close off the vestibule for a private food delivery. The staff is attentive and remembered us whenever we came by reception with a question. The food at the restaurant was delicious and beautifully presented. We are only sorry that we stayed only one night."
50,2022,5,Thank you Lifestyle team,"This hotel deserves a lot more than the flak reviews you read. First time staying here for our anniversary. The hotel room is nice and comfortable. Mini bar complimentary - which is a really really nice touch. Special thanks and mention to Paolo from front desk. He was so patient with the check, trying to find us a room on a higher floor and when he couldn't, he brought us to the room allocated and walked us through the room details like lights, ipad etc. We had a small issue but he resolved it promptly and efficiently and really showed what it means to stay at The Armani - fantastic customer service! Just top notch! Thank you to the service team and front desk. We really enjoyed our stay. The only thing that we would like to suggest is an improvement of the WiFi. We stayed‚Ä¶"
50,2022,5,Anniversary stay in Milan,"My 2nd stay at the Armani. The service is now top notch. Staff are friendly, service oriented and everything requested is attended to promptly. Our big big thanks to Paolo from frontdesk. From check in to attending to our queries and even a minor issue we had - everything was done with a smile and resolved quickly and promptly. Paolo deserves 10 stars! Thank you Armani and Paolo, for such service and a great experience! We will be back!"
50,2022,4,Enjoyable trip,"It is not the first time we visit Milan but it is the first time in Armani Hotel, it was great that we chose this hotel, its location, quality of rooms, services and staff, everything was great, I will never forget Mr. Faisal, Mr. Simone and Mrs. Lara, and I apologize for forgetting the other names. Thank you everyone for their kindness to my children. The room type was a family suite consisting of two interconnecting rooms."
50,2022,3,Best decor and service,"Amazing service ,staff and decor . Great Rooms , restaurant. Location is great for shopping and dining .Staff is very pleasant with prompt attention. I have stayed many times and each time it was great"
50,2022,3,Excellent Hotel,"Stunningly designed hotel, with technological control in the room. Close to all the sites in the center of Milan. An amazing team that generously responded to all our requests. Free minibar for the entire stay including refilling every day, Late check out free of charge. Receiving ‚Ç¨ 85 to use for extras at the hotel. 10% discount at Armani's flagship store."
50,2022,3,Milan Trip,"Great place brilliant location and staff are wonderful, i would recommend it to all my friends and stay again, i really enjoyed the bamboo bar and the room was great. having a parking service made life so easy."
50,2021,12,best experience in MILANO,"very satisfied the complete stay in the hotel, friendly staff, nice room, good facilities, really EVERYTHING was very very good. the relaxation room was my favorite place, in the center of the city a very quiete place to relax, thanks again , see you soon BACK"
50,2021,12,City Trip,"I had the most wonderful and comfortable stay. The rooms are of a good size with a big and luxurious bathroom. The Spa has a beautiful view of the city, from al areas. Jacuzzi is nice and big. Sauna‚Äôs are 1-2 persons, but multiple of them and also with a view of the city. Location is great ofcourse!"
50,2021,11,Magic weekend in Milan,Top notch service during Covid All perfect Very attentive service Nice in dining any time of the day Very nice spa with Jacuzzi and top view Very nice cocktails in the bar Perfect location next to Monte Napoleone area
50,2021,11,Definitely my favourite hotel in Milan,"Perfect hospitality. Sophisticated interior design and flawless service. This is my favorite hotel in Milan. I love the sleek yet modern vibe. The room, the room service, the breakfast, the turndown service, Bamboo Bar... extraordinary experience. I had a great time."
50,2021,11,Best Hotel in Italy,I stayed at the Armani w/ my family in the family room (bedroom w/ a connecting room). The size of both the bedrooms and bathrooms were great. The hotel is first class but the service they provide during your stay is incredible. You never wait for any request and the staff goes above and beyond to provide great service. I would suggest this hotel over any other in Milan.
20,2021,11,a shame at this price point,"I created a tripadvisor account just to report on the experience I had at the armani hotel in milan vs other hotels I stayed at recently: the occasion of stay was a couple night out at la scala for an opera, on the way back from Venice where we stayed at the Aman. For reference I have previously stayed at the Armani in Dubai and eaten in the Paris Armani restaurant and they were pleasurable experiences - room was a junior suite, budget 1'000‚Ç¨ plus - location is good - suite size is ok, bathroom of good size - design of interest but wear and tear are very present - technology is completely outdated and inoperative mostly: 1. the room was cold, putting the temperature up didn't fix it - a member of staff had to come and do something in the background 2. internet access‚Ä¶"
50,2021,11,Amazing hotel and service,"I have travelled the world, and I have stayed at some of the most exclusive hotels. Hands down this is one of the best hotels. The service and accommodations were flawless. We were upgraded to a junior suit. The room was huge and the amenities were fantastic. I highly recommend this hotel. You will not go wrong by staying there. The location is also great. We can‚Äôt wait to go back."
40,2021,10,"Good location, sleek hotel","Very sleek hotel and impressive to see. The location is excellent as it is just steps from high end shopping and walkable to the Duomo. The lounge and dining area are also very modern and cool. My criticism is the rooms themselves were not very functional, specifically the bathroom. There is almost no counter space for makeup. There are not many outlets. The outlet in the bathroom didn‚Äôt work, so I had to curl my hair sitting in the floor, using the refrigerator door as a mirror. The use of an iPad to control everything seems cool initially, but became annoying to turn on the lights and turn off the TV. Armani hotel is a nice hotel, but can use some modern updates to make it more functional."
50,2021,9,Armani - Home away from Home,"This is a Fantastic hotel and fantastic staff all around in the middle of Milan, central to everything via walking of by car or tram. Have always wanted to visit Milan and the Armani Hotel made it the best location for my first visit to the NYC of Italy."
50,2021,9,Mr. Mitja Mihic,"I love your property and book it whenever I come to town for my business trip, the service is wonderful and friendly, eager to help with a smile. I appreciate the attention to detail have a lovely day"
50,2021,9,Best hotel in Milan,"Best hotel in Milan, it is impeccable! Nice amenities, free minibar, great service, best location, you cannot go wrong! Breakfast is very good you can have everything you want, even what is not including in the menu! I believe Armani Hotel is the best hotel in Milan"
10,2021,9,"Worst experience, racist staff foreigners are not welcome in Armani Hotel Milan.","Worst experience, rude and abusive staff do not stay here if your not Italian. I cannot believe I was treated like this. I even have mosquito bites from the bed sheets, room service was horrible, uncooked food and they gave me mango juice half glass or syrup only."
50,2021,8,August 2021,"Returned to Milan for the first time since the pandemic. Have always loved Armani for it's fantastic location, service, amenities, and overall aesthetic. Staff are lovely and helped arrange same-day dinner reservations at Michelin star restaurants, as well as a in-room Covid test prior to departure. The rooms are starting to show their age in terms of wear and are starting to feel a bit dated/stale, as would be expected after 10 illustrious years. The room control system is excellent, but the televisions could be larger, with better resolution and an easy way to cast content from a device. Armani Ristorante is one of my favorite spots in Milan for drinks/dinner, but unfortunately was closed due to Covid. Despite the small gripes, it remains one of my favorite places to stay when‚Ä¶"
50,2021,8,Excellent Hotel,We had a very pleasant stay. The service is excellent and the hotel staff very accommodating. The rooms are clean and have a very spacious layout. The mini-bar is already included in the price. All in all this hotel is absolutely recommendable!
50,2021,8,Mother/daughter short trip,"The location is the best! The ambiance and style is very Armani, simplicity at its highest level. Dining experience at the Bamboo was exquisite and the staff knowledgeable and very friendly! We will be happy to return in the future. Molto grazie a tutti! Aisha und Ariane"
50,2021,8,True to the Armani Design Culture,"This hotel is an experience, not a booking. In the heart of the Milan fashion district it reflects the elegant design culture of Armani: minimalist, yet grand. The service was excellent while not being over bearing. The room, technology and security were excellent. The food was outstanding. It is the perfect high-end retreat while visiting Milan."
40,2021,7,armani hotel milano,"arriving to the hotel door doesn‚Äôt take you to reception/ lobby, you have to take an elevator and there was no guidance ( people or sings). we just guessed it. before coming, i have made more than 2 calls and 3 emails regarding a special request regarding my rooms ( to have them all next to each other), the receptionist was not informed and handed me cards of random rooms that are on the same floor. the receptionist did not offer to take us to the rooms, she just handed the cards which was a bit strange for such a hotel, so i asked her to. we had a 1 hour wait time in one room until the room issue was resolved. we have to take 2 elevators to get to our rooms or exit. check in area is pretty compact, so every time i passed by there was be a group of people standing waiting‚Ä¶"
40,2021,7,Excellent Attention to Details,"The rooms are top notch and the hotel is superbly located. Staff is very friendly. Little details in the room - delivery of fruits and chocolates; well equipped fitness center with a view; room feel new and bath is to die for - shower, bathtub, sinks - everything. A small problem which separates me from a 5 star review - my Surface laptop had on and off problems with the WiFi. My phone didn't but I've also used my Surface in many hotels, so who knows. I alerted the reception and they said they will call the technician but nothing happened. I couldn't use my laptop much during the last 12 hours or so of my stay. I would get WiFi for 15-30 min and then it will cut out for few hours - it almost felt like it was throttling me."
40,2021,7,Everything is beautiful about this hotel except the duty manager,"The Hotel is a 'go-to' place with an amazing design but it's people who do it. I want to say 'thank you' to Meghan from reception, be sure if you address her your request will be fulfilled efficiently. Restaurants have friendly and welcoming personnel but Lilia, Biagio and Pasquale are outstanding! Contrary if you don't want to spoil your mood avoid Luca with his arrogant and moody attitude and you will enjoy the property to the full!"
50,2021,6,Amazing hotel with amazing staff,We stayed one night in Milan at the end of our Italy trip to catch an early flight. The hotel that we first checked into was a disaster! We talked to Luca about transferring to the Armani Hotel. He got us checked into our room quickly and effortlessly. The hotel and room were amazing. We were so relieved and happy to be able to kick back and relax in our comfy room. The Bamboo Bar was great as well. We also enjoyed room service and a wonderful breakfast. My only suggestion would be to add more vegan options to the menus. This is a great hotel in a Milan and the staff is amazing. We would love to return one day and stay longer than one night! Thanks for making our time in Milan so enjoyable!
50,2021,6,Amazing....every time,"I love everything about the Armani hotel, one week ago was my 4th time there and everything its always amazing. The service is excellent, they always think one step ahead to fulfill any wishes (even the man from the valet parking when we ask him if they had an item of personal care in the hotel or if there was some pharmacy around: he just told the housekeeping and this item was in our bathroom when we came back). Service is great, the location is great, the breakfast, the branding with their own fragrance, creams, snacks, chocolates, etc...its perfect, one of my favorite hotel!"
50,2021,5,perfect...,Really good not to far from anything. The road is very quiet and peaceful. The staff is very helpful. The breakfast is very delicious. Perfect service and nice staff! Rooms and bathrooms were clean and decorated nicely and staff were impeccable! Would definitely return here. Perfect service and nice staff!
50,2020,10,Great Milano Hotel - Very Well Located,"This hotel is all you expect from Armani. Design, size of the room etc. Really enjoyed my time there. I was only disappointed by the Concierge service which was not able to help organize or reserve anything for me. A bit bad in such a great hotel."
50,2020,10,Great!,"As far as I can this hotel is perfect. My bedroom was amazing, with a nice terrace and a great view. The pool at 8th floor with the panoramic view is relaxing and astonishing. The possibility to control everything in your room with a tablet is very comfortable. the Hotel staff is kind and professional. As soon as Covid situation gets better I will go Back to Armani Hotel for sure."
50,2020,9,Amazing stay!,"The Armani hotel represents all the values of the Armani brand, ie elegance, fashionable, high class... although it might not be a hotel recommended for families, our child felt like home (or even better) thanks to the high professionalism of the crew. It was 2 days of an absolute relax and one of the best city break ever!"
40,2020,9,CORRECT PRICE / QUALITY,"Good and well located hotel in the centre of Milan.The personel is very friendly, even the concierge for making bookings outside the hotel. Check-in takes too much time, especialy in this Covid19 period, so identity cards and credit cards can be mailed before check-in. Check-out was fast and sufficent."
50,2020,8,Great hotel in Milano,"My friend and I stayed at the Armani hotel for two nights and had an amazing time, I really recommend this hotel to anyone spending some days in Milano. The location was great, the service really good, the room very spacious and comfortable and breakfast incredibly good. We got amazing suggestions from the Front office team, particularly from Andrea who made us feel at home during our whole stay."
50,2020,8,Wonderful safe stay in Milan,Perfect location for visiting the Milan centre. There are not many tourists at the moment and the hotel is very professional with measures to stay safe. Very friendly staff. Great area to explore the city.
50,2019,8,Nice modern hotel.,"Nice rooms, with lots of room. Very tidy and modern for Italy. Staff were very helpful and friendly. Bit of a walk from the main hub of the resturants but not too bad. Loved the Ferrari Factory. Thanks."
30,2019,10,Expected better since it‚Äôs an Armani hotel,"The location is perfect! Some staff can be really friendly, some staff high attitude, so in a way it‚Äôs like gambling. Breakfast is lacking varieties. Service is very good, free drinks in the minibar. Spacious bathroom, but the room could be a bit small. Willing to give you another chance when this madness is over. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
50,2020,1,Amazingly Wonderful,"I loved everything about this hotel: the ambiance, the service and amenities. The staff is extremely attentive to your needs. At every turn was perfection! The breakfast selection was good, but prix course lunch was phenomenal. We also ordered room service for dinner, which arrived in no time. The spa offers a relaxing experience with wonderful views of the city. By far, this is one of my most favorite hotels and I will for sure be returning."
50,2019,12,A very Merry Christmas for someone who isn‚Äôt a Christmas person üòÉ,"My third visit and everything is just as excellent as before. I am not a fan of Christmas so wanted to get away from the nonsense for a few days - how wonderful to not have decorations everywhere. I have to call out the management and staff in the Armani ristorante and bamboo bar for once again dealing with my vegan diet so gracefully. Simply but exceptional quality food. As I‚Äôm interested in design I asked to see one of the hotel suits and the reception staff were more than happy to show me around and answer my questions. What a pleasure! The spa pool and gym are very comfortable and feel welcoming to me, not too big and imposing and the staff are friendly whilst being very respectful of your privacy - I really like that approach. I feel very comfortable here and I think‚Ä¶"
50,2020,1,Armani Heritage,A truly luxury experience.The design of the hotel from the entrance to the smallest details was superb.We were amazed from the stuff.Everyone was very kind to assist us with everything we needed.We loved the breakfast and the amazing view from the bar to the Via Monte Napoleone. One of the reasons we love to stay in Milan.
50,2020,1,Decent hotel,"Super modern hotel in a really good location. The rooms are why this hotel is so good. They are modern, large, comfortable and very quiet. The technology that runs them is great, though a bit annoying with all the light it puts out - impossible to get the room pitch black. Bathrooms are fabulous. The spa pool is lovely with great views over Milan. I would recommend them having hours for kids to be able to use the pool, quite frustrating that they don't allow kids at all. Breakfast was decent but over priced. Other guests obviously felt this way too as we were the only ones ever there and the 6-7 waiters just hung around."
50,2020,1,my new favorite hotel,"One of the best thought out suites we have ever stayed in. PLUS we got upgraded to a higher level of suite and we are rarely upgraded, even on Centurian program,. The room was controlled by an ipad that was instantly understandable. no training needed. Every one made us feel welcome and could not do enough for us. the heated floor in the bathrooms were amazing. Restaurants and bar seemed ok but we had lots of plans in Milan and we did not use them. comp breakfast was fine."
50,2019,9,Great location,Great location of the famous fashion designer in Milan. Gorgeous furniture and designs objects and lights everywhere. Great views from the breakfast room: you can see Milan skyline. Sports equipment and SPA are excellent.
50,2019,11,Deserves a star Michelin again,"Great Hotel as a whole. Back again after long time Quality, service elegance is still what makes this Hotel ones of the best in Milan. Restaurant for dinner is outstanding . Deserves for sure to gain the Michelin star again. Food, service and ambience is top class."
10,2019,11,You want to feel old - go here....,The hotel and the service are really ok... I started feeling comfortable here. I was thinking about staying in the mandarin oriental or Armani - wrong choice if you are 35 + :-)) The restaurant was nearly empty (on a friday night) and the bar was filled with people in the average age of 18.... so I felt like picking up my daughter. Sorry - the hotel must make a decision ... I will never come back again... I pay a fortune for a room and sit with teenies in a bar - no way...
50,2019,9,Excellent Armani restaurant,"The service was beyond excellent. The food, the drinks, the service, the location, the atmosphere... one word ... exceptional. When in Milan, a dinner you you have to do. Loved it! Thank you for the excellent food and service."
50,2019,9,Completely perfect,"My boyfriend and I spent 3 nights at the Armani Hotel during our stay in Milano. We were truly blown away from start to finish. You get exactly what you pay for- every penny was worth this experience. The staff are attentive and every detail is just perfect. The room was fabulous- interior, layout beautiful and every element controlled via an iPad. You also get 15% off to use within the building, whether that be the restaurant, shop, room service etc which was definitely worth it considering we spent our final night in the Bamboo bar. The room specifications were sublime. The most stunning bedroom, bathroom and comfortable bed- you haven‚Äôt experienced luxury until you experience this hotel! The ONLY downside was the bath- it was a tiny tiny bath that just didn‚Äôt fit in with the‚Ä¶"
40,2019,9,Very good,"The hotel itself is gorgeous, with a decent sized room for European Standards. Check in and reception desk service are Excellent, as is location and amenities. The only criticism I would raise is regarding the very slow service at breakfast and restaurant, which can be quite frustrating. While no noise can be heard in the rooms, the lobby bar and front entrance may get loud and crowded during the night - which is not really a 5 star hotel feeling...."
50,2019,9,Excellent and memorable stay,I took my sister to visit Milan for her birthday and choose to stay at Armani Hotel. It was the best decision ever. From checking in to check out was smooth. They updated our room and are very helpful. We felt instantly at home and comfortable. The amenities are exquisite. It was really an exceptional experience for us. Thank you Armani Hotel for making our stay in Milano so special.
40,2019,7,Real luxury Made in italy,My wife Jennifer and I stayed at this beautiful hotel . Great staff and superb breakfast . You can breathe air of the veto fashion Made in italy. We will return soon . Great place to visit Milan and go shopping .
50,2019,8,A Fantastic Hotel,This is place should be part of UNESCO. Room is just fantastic and all service are incredible amazing. I believe it is hard to find a better resort in Italy or in Europe. the service is elegant and warm ..
50,2019,8,A modern masterclass,Everything felt right about this hotel. The ambience was classic Armani. The valet parking team saved me a hefty fine from Milan council as I had totally missed the requirement to pay the Congestion Charge area (Area C) until I read about it 2 days later - but the hotel had already paid it for me when I asked them about it so thank you for that ! The business centre had everything one will need - projectors / internet etc The location was second to none - about 10 minutes from Milan Duomo Breakfast was the usual continental stuff.
40,2019,8,Good experience - a few missing points,"This place oozes with design, as you would expect with the brand. We were given a complementary upgrade to a larger room which was very appreciated. The room had a round foyer, which was unique and made you feel you were coming 'home'. The concierge team is hard working and aims to please which is appreciated especially in months like August when much of the town is shut down. A few points to improve: we only realised after making purchases in the Armani shop downstairs that guests were entitled to a discount. I found this at random on the iPad in the room. why was this not made a special feature? we asked for a harder pillow - it took several requests to get one. Parking is extraordinarily high - we were charged 65Euro / night. I understand this is Milan, but keep‚Ä¶"
30,2019,8,"We loved the place, but this time we were disappointed.","We are frequent visitors of this hotel, which was our favorite place in Milano. But this time service was way below average, repetitively over a few days, and the staff seemed fairly superficial in their attempt to remedy our experience. No real attempt to make an unhappy client into a happy one. Before, the super-service felt genuine, this time it felt as if the staff members were 'forced' to put up a show of a good service, but service was not as good as before. Some front desk staff members were indifferent and some of the staff members at the entrance were really rude. Maintenance and housekeeping staff (and we needed those more than one would expect) could not speak English or communicate with us. Next time Four Seasons."
50,2019,8,Must try once in a lifetime,"Armani Hotel & Resorts, and the Armani fashion chains are so famous in the world. One must try in a lifetime, impeccable services by the Armani team! The breakfast with the Italian Prosecco is a big plus üòÄ"
50,2019,6,Beautiful,"Beautiful Hotel, Professional and Friendly staff. Great Location. Nice Breakfast . Great Bar, drinks and snacks. Walking distance to Fashion, Duomo, shopping and restaurants. Reception is very helpful."
50,2019,6,Perfect Five Star Experience,"As always, a flawless experience in a perfect location in Milano. Given that the temperature outside was 36 degrees when we visited, the convenient location directly next to Monte Napoleone and the subway was a bigger plus than it is already with normal temperatures."
50,2019,6,Beautiful hotel - miss pay TV,"Beautiful hotel right in the middle of Milan's fashion district. Minimalistic, but soothing and large enough rooms in pure Armani style. You will probably feel the need to replenish your wardrobe in the nearby boutiques, so the space is appreciated. The only complain is the absurdly missing pay TV, who broadcasts all sports in Italy. Staff was kind and prepared. Special mention to room service David, who served us perfectly for a week and was so kind to lend us his online account so that we could see Raptors final game. Very nice Spa."
50,2018,7,The best,This was a very good Hotel. It is probably one of the best experiences i have had. Modern and clean. The service was just amazing. It is very nicely located and shops are very accessible. Restaurants are very close and the concierge was 10/10
50,2018,11,Hotel for shoppers,"Modern minimalist hotel closed to shopping street, Via Della Spiga. 10 minutes walk to Piazza del Duomo. Well appointed room. Nice and spacious bathroom with bathtub facing street. Breakfast was simple but delicious. Professional and helpful staffs."
50,2019,6,A very warm welcome!,"Yesterday night, I went to Armani Hotel Milano with some friends for an aperitif. We had a really warm and kind welcome at the entrance in Via Manzoni by a guy called Andrea (I think this is his name) who showed us the way to the Bamboo Bar. We had really fun moments while taking our aperitif... and what an amazing bar!!! We will come back for sure, amazing service!!"
10,2019,6,2 star service & property for a 7 star price,"We came here to celebrate my parents anniversary and it was the most terrible experience we had. Other than the fact that they didn‚Äôt seem to care about their guests, everything was worse than the next. The entrance lobby was so inconvenient, the elevator buttons had to be pushed real hard to get access. Our room was not well maintained. The bathroom had a very foul smell and the air conditioning wasn‚Äôt working. Despite our complains they were extremely rude & curt at all times. Even the water bottles were hard to use and it just felt like we are in a dingy, dull, unfriendly hotel. Please do not waste your money to come stay here, it will only spoil your mood & time. I wish I didn‚Äôt book this hotel and booked absolutely anything else in Milan. Highly disappointed &‚Ä¶"
50,2019,5,Grazie,"This modern hotel that looks like a bunker from the outside is a wonderful place to stay in Milan. The bunker gives way to a modern and somewhat dark hotel but the rooms are spacious, comfortable and very chic. We had a balcony room with a nice view and enjoyed not only the room but room service. The overall service was very good and attentive. The location is perfect and has easy access to shopping and the main sites in central Milan. Though the hotel is a bit dark for my tastes it worked and overall this is a great hotel."
50,2019,5,simply TOP,"Great coming back after some time finding the place in best shape ... great service, cosy rooms, the Spa in good condition, the restaurant and bar nice as always, also good and helpful service at the entrance"
50,2018,8,Amazing Armani,"We always love to visit the city of Milan. Our stay at the Armani was marvelous. The check in, the room is high tech ,modern . The service is slick with style. The position was very convenient and a 5 min walk to the Duomo. To our surprise , we discovered that our neighbor in the room next door was none other than Rihanna. So many security personnel in the corridors. Was fun ."
50,2019,4,Lovely Hotel & Staff,Really enjoyed the our stay here - very modern with lovely helpful staff - had a fantastic meal in the restaurant last night with some fabulous cocktails - the hotel is operated by emaar who also operate the address hotels in Dubai 5* all the way

50,2019,3,Thank you Georgio Armani,"We went to Milano for a long weekend and were looking for a 'special hotel treat' for ourselves. The ARMANI hotel is how a hotel should be - we assume that the name giver has probably collected all the experience he made in his life at all the hotels in the world and used this as the 'guideline' for his own version. The rooms are spacious with all the things you need, the bed is extremely comfortable with special lining from various parts of the world, bathroom stunning and all items are in the Armani style. The hotel rooms are quiet which is not always the case even in 5* hotels as the rooms have their own little lobby which provides as well noise insulation. The housekeeping staff moves and works quietly and the doors/elevators etc seem to work without any sound. Common areas‚Ä¶"
20,2019,2,Designer Imposter Perfume,"I am extremely disappointed in our stay and at the level of service. This was our first (and last) time staying at Armani. We usually stay at Bulgari or Park Hyatt Milano, but both were completely booked for fashion week, even though I did book almost a year in advance, nevertheless, as an American Express Fine Hotels & Resorts property, we booked a Premier King at Armani. You should not equate technology with luxury! When we first arrived at the hotel, we walked in and no one was at the desk at street level, a man did appear and said we needed to go up to the lobby to check in (FYI, the Lobby is on the 7th floor, you take one elevator from street level to lobby, and a different set of elevators for rooms). Our room was beautiful, though note there are no doorknobs to access‚Ä¶"
50,2018,4,Absolutely amazing hotel :),Stayed in the Armani hotel in April last year and had to do this review as I literally fell in love with this place. My partner and I stayed for 4 nights and we had a lovely stay in Milan which was our first time I Italy too. We had a suite and it was absolutely beautiful inside really big and spacious with own balcony. I loved it it felt like an apartment - the rooms have this chic cool vibe but not super modern so still traditional! The bed was ultra comfy and I like the room as we had electric blinds and it got totally dark. The bathroom has shower and bath and both bedroom and bathroom were spotless. The hotel has a special smell which they must put into the heating cooling system and it just smells lovely all the time in rooms and reception etc. The spa was on a higher‚Ä¶
50,2019,1,When design meets your needs,"Great hotel with the italien moderne feeling. The team all over very friendly, helpfull and professional, they made the hotel a great experience. Rooms win a lot when you spend a time - everything work so well, and all designed for the guests individual need in mind. Public spaces feels a bit empty and cold - its not a really happening hotel."
50,2018,12,One of life‚Äôs little luxuries,"We stayed in the standard room which was really impressive with its entrance and hallway to the room with walk-in wardrobe. The bathroom was large and luxurious and the heated floor was a lovely touch. The room was large and comfortable as you would expect with a gorgeous, comfy bed. But the real treat was a lovely, long balcony which was a nice sun trap, perfect for sitting out with a coffee. The other special touch we really enjoyed in the room was the complimentary mini bar and snacks, perfect for when you‚Äôre a little peckish before dinner. We used the pool which was lovely with great views of the city. The location was perfect with a metro station right outside and just a ten minute walk to the Duomo. Staff were friendly and helpful too."
50,2018,12,SPA - Beautiful experience,"We really enjoyed the spa at Armani hotel, friendly staff, convenient facilities. Everything we needed was provided promptly and in the conditions you would expect from such an important brand. There's a very nice view from the 8th floor. Overall really good value for money."
50,2018,12,Beautiful hotel and superb service especially pascalque,We had a great time at Armani hotel in 304. The spa is outstanding and has a beautiful. View. We had breakfast at Armani Resturant and PASCAL was really helpful . Thanks to people like pascal the hotel is outstanding. The minestrone soup was outstanding. Even if you don‚Äôt stay surely visit the Resturant.
50,2018,12,Excellent property....but scope of improvement in services,"It‚Äôs an excellent property. Very well located right in the middle of the fashion district. Ultra luxury, but need more focus on service. Small things like moisturiser in bathroom was missing. 3 people staying in the room and bathroom amenities only for 2 people. Can do better on the menu at the restaurant. Breakfast service on day 1 & 2 was excellent by day 3 was average. Concierge services were great."
50,2018,12,Amazing Hotel,"The hotel is really great. Design, Atmosphere, Front Desk. It‚Äôs a pity the hostess in the restaurant sent my wife in Christmas dinner back to room because she wore new shoes from a design boutique in Via della Spiga in Milan. She called it ‚Äúsneakers ‚Äú... Besides that, everything was perfect. One of the best hotels I‚Äôve ever stayed."
50,2018,12,Perfect location,"Perfect location for shopping. Short walking distance to all the boutiques in Milan, and another 10 minutes walk to The Duomo. Our room was good size and nicely designed. My only reservation about this hotel is the access to go in and out of the hotel. The lobby is located on the 7th floor, while the rooms are on the floors below. The only way to get to your room is by taking the elevator to 7th, and change elevator to your floor. Same as when you wanna exit the hotel. Everything has to go through the 7th floor. Tried the food at The Bamboo Bar and was very disappointed."
